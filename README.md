    Azure Entra ID Identity Governance & Privileged Access Implementation
  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of enterprise-grade identity security controls using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

The focus was on reducing privilege risk, enforcing least privilege access, and implementing Zero Trust identity principles.

This lab simulates how modern organizations secure their cloud identity infrastructure.

  Objectives

Eliminate standing privileged access

Enforce Just-in-Time (JIT) administrative access

Implement identity governance controls

Reduce privilege creep

Apply Zero Trust architecture principles

Secure access using Conditional Access policies

    Architecture Overview

Environment Components:

Microsoft Entra ID Tenant

Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access Reviews

Conditional Access Policies

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Security Model Applied:

Identity-first security

Least privilege

Time-bound role activation

Continuous verification

   Implementation Steps
1.) Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

Converted permanent Global Administrator roles to Eligible assignments

Configured Just-in-Time activation

Required MFA for role activation

Set approval workflow for sensitive roles

Result:
Reduced risk of privilege abuse and credential compromise.

2.) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Assigned roles based strictly on job function

Eliminated excessive admin permissions

Applied least privilege principle

Result:
Minimized attack surface and insider threat exposure.

3.) Identity Governance – Access Reviews

Configured periodic access reviews

Assigned reviewers for role validation

Enabled automatic removal of unapproved access

Result:
Prevented privilege creep and orphaned account risk.

4.) Conditional Access Policies

Enforced MFA for privileged roles

Restricted access based on risk conditions

Applied location-based access controls

Result:
Strengthened Zero Trust posture and improved compliance.

 Security Impact

✔ Reduced standing administrative privileges
✔ Enforced time-bound elevated access
✔ Implemented automated governance controls
✔ Improved organizational security posture
✔ Applied Zero Trust identity strategy
